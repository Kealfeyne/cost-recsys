# cost-recsys

This project is aimed at developing a dynamic pricing system for e-commerce platforms. The system includes predictive modeling, demand elasticity analysis, and price optimization under business constraints. 

## Features
- **Demand Prediction**: Utilizes machine learning to predict product demand based on historical data.
- **Elasticity Curve Analysis**: Models the relationship between price changes and demand fluctuations.
- **Price Optimization**: Suggests optimal pricing strategies to maximize revenue or achieve other KPIs.

## Project Components
1. **Data Preprocessing**: 
   - Conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA) using tools like Pandas, Matplotlib, and NumPy.
   - Extracted and engineered features such as weekly sales summaries, elasticity indicators, and gross market value.

2. **Machine Learning Model**:
   - Implemented regression models using the CatBoost framework.
   - Applied RMSE and MAE for loss function evaluation and error interpretation.

3. **Optimization Logic**:
   - Developed methods to adjust pricing dynamically based on predicted demand and business constraints.

4. **Visualization**:
   - Visualized results through graphs to highlight demand-price relationships and optimization outcomes.

## Tools and Libraries
- **Python**: Main programming language for analytics and development.
- **Pandas**: Data manipulation and cleaning.
- **Matplotlib**: Data visualization.
- **NumPy**: Numerical computations.
- **CatBoost**: Machine learning framework for regression tasks.

## Team Members
- **Korol Maxim Maximovich**: Project Manager, Data Scientist.
- **Shkolin Alexander Yuryevich**: Data Scientist.
- **Nechaev Danila Konstantinovich**: Data Scientist.
- **Gareev Eldar Rustemovich**: Data Scientist.
